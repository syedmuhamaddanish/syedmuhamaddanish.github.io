### **About me**
I am currently employed as a postdoctoral researcher at ETS Montreal and Hydro-Quebec. My research activities focus on the integration of blockchain technology within energy systems.

I received my Ph.D. from the Département de génie logiciel et des TI of the University ETS Montreal, Quebec in August 2022,with [Prof. Kaiwen Zhang](https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/research/professors/kzhang) as my advisor, and [Prof. Hans-Arno Jacobsen](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/jacobsen-h-a/) as my co-advisor. I received Masters in Electrical Engineering from National University of Sciences & Technology, Pakistan. Before coming to ETS Montreal, I worked with [Prof. Marios Lestas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marios-lestas-708aa5231/) as a research assistant under Erasmus + mobility project at the Frederick university, Cyprus. My hometown is Rawalpindi, Pakistan.

My Ph.D. research was focused on the trusted service selection of consumer applications including IoT and electric vehicles, using blockchain technology. I am excited about applying blockchain technology to secure and improve the implementations of consumer side applications people use day to day. 

Aside from work, I enjoy gym, video games, writing blogs, and listening to traditional indian music.
