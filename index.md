### **About me**
I am currently employed as a postdoctoral researcher at ETS Montreal and Hydro-Quebec. My research activities focus on the integration of blockchain technology within energy systems.

I received my Ph.D. from the Département de génie logiciel et des TI of the University ETS Montreal, Quebec in August 2022,with [Prof. Kaiwen Zhang](https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/research/professors/kzhang) as my advisor, and [Prof. Hans-Arno Jacobsen](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/jacobsen-h-a/) as my co-advisor. I received Masters in Electrical Engineering from National University of Sciences & Technology, Pakistan. Before coming to ETS Montreal, I worked with [Prof. Marios Lestas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marios-lestas-708aa5231/) as a research assistant under Erasmus + mobility project at the Frederick university, Cyprus. My hometown is Rawalpindi, Pakistan.

My Ph.D. research was focused on the trusted service selection of consumer applications including IoT and electric vehicles, using blockchain technology. I am excited about applying blockchain technology to secure and improve the implementations of consumer side applications people use day to day. 

Aside from work, I hit the gym, play video games, make programming tutorials on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7mE5qkEh8J610BpFmwAZyQ), and listen to traditional indian music.

### **Research Projects**

- **Financial compensation of energy users using blockchain technology:** In this project, we employed [decentralized storage technology](https://web3.storage/) and blockchain to calculate the financial compensation of energy users based on their energy consumption data. We architected an end-to-end design to integrate the financial decentralized application in an on-chain and off-chain manner. We also performed comprehensive performance evaluation considering different blockchain systems, e.g., energy web chain, polygon, arbitrum, IoTex, etc, as this application is designed for large-scale energy users. This project is a part of blockchain integration in Hydro-Quebec's software platform.
- **Smart contract-based energy markets:** In this project, we are researching and developing different types of energy markets using smart contract, which manages the supply and demand of the electricity using order book and bids matching algorithm. We are currently architechting the application design based on centralized and decentralized energy markets, and investigating different market clearing mechanisms including optimization and auction mechanism. This project is also a part of blockchain integration in Hydro-Quebec's software platform.
