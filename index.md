### **About me**
I am currently employed as a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer at York University. I received my Ph.D. from the Département de génie logiciel et des TI of the University ETS Montreal, Quebec in August 2022,with [Prof. Kaiwen Zhang](https://www.etsmtl.ca/en/research/professors/kzhang) as my advisor, and [Prof. Hans-Arno Jacobsen](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/people/jacobsen-h-a/) as my co-advisor. I received Masters in Electrical Engineering from National University of Sciences & Technology, Pakistan. Before coming to ETS Montreal, I worked with [Prof. Marios Lestas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marios-lestas-708aa5231/) as a research assistant under Erasmus + mobility project at the Frederick university, Cyprus. My hometown is Rawalpindi, Pakistan.
